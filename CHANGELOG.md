## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Card Lookup by Short ID**: `get_card_by_short(boardId?, cardShort, includeMarkdown?)` - Fetch full card details by a board's human-facing numeric card number (`idShort`, e.g. `#42`); falls back to the default board when `boardId` is omitted. `cardShort` also accepts an array (e.g. `[42, 43, 51]`) to fetch several cards in one call, returning each under a greppable `# Card #<n>: <name>` heading; a short ID that cannot be fetched reports its error in place instead of failing the whole batch
- **Streamable HTTP transport**: The server can now run over the modern MCP Streamable HTTP transport in addition to stdio (which remains the default and unchanged). Opt in with `TRELLO_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`; configure the bind address/port with `TRELLO_MCP_HTTP_HOST` / `TRELLO_MCP_HTTP_PORT`, an optional bearer token with `TRELLO_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, the DNS-rebinding `Host` allow-list with `TRELLO_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and the session idle timeout with `TRELLO_MCP_HTTP_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default 1800; `0` disables). Uses per-session MCP servers over a single shared Trello client so board/workspace selection persists across requests. Idle sessions are swept, since clients close the socket rather than sending the `DELETE /mcp` that would otherwise be the only way to release one. Legacy SSE transport is intentionally not supported.
- **Label filter on `get_cards_by_list_id`**: New optional `labelId` argument returns only cards carrying the given Trello label ID. Applied client-side and composes with `nameFilter`.
- **List Position Management**: `update_list_position(listId, position)` - Reorder lists on a board using Trello's fractional indexing ("top", "bottom", or a numeric position)
- **List Management**: `update_list(listId, name?, closed?, subscribed?, idBoard?)` - Update a list's name, closed state, subscription, or move it to a different board
