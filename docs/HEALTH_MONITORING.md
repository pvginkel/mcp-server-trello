# Trello MCP Health Monitoring System 🏥

## Overview

The Trello MCP server now includes a comprehensive health monitoring system that provides real-time diagnostics and performance analysis. Think of it as having a team of world-class physicians constantly monitoring your API's cardiovascular health! 

## Available Health Endpoints

### 1. Basic Health Check - `get_health`
**Quick pulse check for monitoring systems**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|critical",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-01T03:13:26Z", 
  "uptime_ms": 3600000,
  "checks_passed": 4,
  "total_checks": 4,
  "response_time_ms": 156,
  "success_rate": "98.5%"
}
```

Perfect for:
- Load balancer health checks
- Monitoring dashboard integration  
- Quick operational status verification

### 2. Detailed Health Diagnostic - `get_health_detailed`
**Comprehensive medical examination**

Includes:
- ✅ Trello API connectivity verification
- 🏗️ Board access validation
- ⚡ Rate limiter health analysis  
- 📊 Performance metrics assessment
- 📋 List operations testing (detailed mode)
- 🎴 Card operations verification (detailed mode)
- ☑️ Checklist functionality testing (detailed mode)
- 🏢 Workspace access validation (detailed mode)

Returns complete `SystemHealthReport` with:
- Individual check results with timing
- Overall system status determination
- Automated repair recommendations
- Performance metrics analysis

**Ambient selection off**: when `TRELLO_MCP_AMBIENT_SELECTION=off` (the default under the HTTP transport) and no `TRELLO_BOARD_ID` is configured, there is no board for the board-scoped checks to exercise — every board-scoped call carries its own `boardId`. Those checks report `not checked` and count as 🟢 HEALTHY, rather than pinning the whole report at DEGRADED forever.

### 3. Metadata Consistency Check - `get_health_metadata`
**Data integrity scanner**

Verifies consistency between:
- Board configuration and accessibility
- List structure and organization
- Card distribution and assignments
- Checklist availability and completeness
- Workspace settings alignment

### 4. Performance Analysis - `get_health_performance`
**Cardiovascular stress test**

Provides detailed metrics:
- Response time analysis with grading (A+ to F)
- Success rate monitoring
- Throughput measurement (requests per minute)
- Rate limit utilization tracking
- Performance trend analysis

### 5. Automated System Repair - `perform_system_repair`
**Digital emergency room**

Attempts to automatically fix:
- Missing active board configuration
- Workspace inconsistencies
- Basic connectivity issues

Setting an active board is the only repair it knows how to make, and ambient selection off is precisely what forbids that. In that mode it reports that no repairs are available instead of hunting for something it could not fix anyway.

## Health Status Levels

- **🟢 HEALTHY**: All systems operating optimally
- **🟡 DEGRADED**: Minor issues detected, functionality maintained  
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Serious issues requiring immediate attention
- **⚪ UNKNOWN**: Unable to determine status

## Performance Grading System

The health monitor assigns letter grades (A+ to F) based on:

- **Response Time (40% weight)**:
  - A+/A: < 200ms (excellent)
  - B: 200-500ms (good)  
  - C: 500-1000ms (fair)
  - D: 1000-2000ms (slow)
  - F: > 2000ms (very slow)

- **Success Rate (35% weight)**:
  - A+: ≥ 99% success rate
  - A: ≥ 95% success rate
  - B: ≥ 90% success rate  
  - C: ≥ 80% success rate
  - D/F: < 80% success rate

- **Rate Limit Utilization (25% weight)**:
  - A+/A: < 50% utilization (optimal)
  - B: 50-70% utilization (moderate)
  - C: 70-85% utilization (high)
  - D: 85-95% utilization (near limit)
  - F: > 95% utilization (critical)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Check
```typescript
// Check basic system status
const health = await mcpClient.callTool('get_health');
console.log('System status:', health.status);
```

### Detailed Diagnostic
```typescript
// Get comprehensive health report
const detailedHealth = await mcpClient.callTool('get_health_detailed');
console.log('Recommendations:', detailedHealth.recommendations);
console.log('Performance grade:', detailedHealth.performance_metrics);
```

### Metadata Verification
```typescript
// Check data consistency
const metadataHealth = await mcpClient.callTool('get_health_metadata');
if (!metadataHealth.metadata_consistency.consistent) {
  console.log('Issues found:', metadataHealth.metadata_consistency.issues);
}
```

### Performance Analysis
```typescript
// Analyze system performance
const performance = await mcpClient.callTool('get_health_performance');
console.log('Grade:', performance.performance_grade);
console.log('Response time rating:', performance.analysis.response_time_rating);
```

### Automated Repair
```typescript
// Attempt system repair
const repair = await mcpClient.callTool('perform_system_repair');
if (repair.success) {
  console.log('Repairs completed:', repair.actions_taken);
}
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Prometheus Metrics
The health endpoints return structured data perfect for Prometheus scraping:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'trello-mcp-health'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    metrics_path: '/health'
    scrape_interval: 30s
```

### Grafana Dashboard
Create visualizations using the performance metrics:
- Response time trends
- Success rate monitoring  
- Rate limit utilization
- Health check status over time

### Alerting Rules
Set up alerts based on health status:
- Critical status: Immediate notification
- Degraded status: Warning notification
- Performance grade below B: Performance alert

## Background Monitoring

The health monitor automatically:
- 🔄 Tracks performance metrics for all API calls
- 📊 Calculates rolling averages and success rates
- 🧹 Cleans up old metrics to prevent memory leaks
- 💾 Maintains request history for analysis
- ⏰ Provides uptime tracking from service start

## Error Handling

All health endpoints include robust error handling:
- Graceful degradation during API issues
- Detailed error reporting with context
- Fallback to cached results when possible
- Safe failure modes that don't impact main functionality

## Security Considerations

- Health endpoints don't expose sensitive credentials
- API key and token information is redacted from responses
- Rate limiting protects against health check abuse
- Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check basic health every 30-60 seconds
2. **Detailed Diagnostics**: Run comprehensive checks every 5-10 minutes  
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor trends over time, not just snapshots
4. **Alert Thresholds**: Set appropriate thresholds for your use case
5. **Repair Usage**: Use automated repair sparingly for non-critical issues

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Status: DEGRADED - "No active board configured"**
- Solution (ambient selection on): Use `set_active_board` tool with a valid board ID
- With ambient selection off: this status does not appear, and `set_active_board` is not registered. Board checks report `not checked` instead; set `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`, or pass `boardId` explicitly on each call, to give them a board to exercise
- Prevention: Always configure a default board in environment variables

**Status: CRITICAL - "Trello API connectivity failed"**  
- Check: Network connectivity to api.trello.com
- Verify: API key and token are valid and not expired
- Consider: Rate limiting or temporary API outages

**Performance Grade: D or F**
- Investigate: Network latency and bandwidth
- Check: Trello API status page for service issues  
- Optimize: Reduce request frequency or implement caching

**High Rate Limit Utilization**
- Implement: Request batching where possible
- Add: Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Consider: Distributing load across multiple API keys/tokens

## API Reference

All health endpoints return consistent response formats:

```typescript
interface HealthResponse {
  content: Array<{ type: 'text'; text: string }>;
  isError?: boolean;
}
```

The `text` field contains JSON-formatted health data specific to each endpoint.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Historical trend analysis
- Predictive failure detection  
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Custom health check definitions
- Advanced repair capabilities
- Performance optimization recommendations
