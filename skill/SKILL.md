# Trello MCP Server Skill

Use this skill when an agent needs to inspect or manage Trello boards through
the bundled MCP server. The skill carries its own server source in
`assets/source/` and installs it locally on first use.

## Activation

Before using Trello tools, verify that the local server has been installed.

1. Check for a built server at:
   `{XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/mcp-server-trello-skill/server/build/index.js`
2. If it is missing, run:
   `bash {skill-root}/scripts/install.sh`
3. Confirm the MCP client has `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` configured.
   Optional values are `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`, `TRELLO_WORKSPACE_ID`,
   `TRELLO_MCP_AMBIENT_SELECTION`, `https_proxy`, and `HTTPS_PROXY`.

The install script builds from `assets/source/` when Bun is available. If Bun is
not available, it falls back to the published package install path and creates a
local wrapper at the same `build/index.js` check path.

## Reading Order

Load only the reference needed for the current Trello task.

- Start with `references/trello-mcp/README.md` for routing.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/configuration.md` for authentication, install, and
  client setup.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/api.md` when you need tool names and parameters.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/patterns.md` for common board, card, checklist,
  and attachment workflows.
- Use `references/trello-mcp/gotchas.md` for date formats, IDs, rate limits,
  and recovery steps.

## Tool Routing

Choose tools by workflow, not by guessing IDs.

- Board discovery: `list_boards`, `list_workspaces`,
  `list_boards_in_workspace`, and, only when ambient selection is on,
  `set_active_board`, `set_active_workspace`, `get_active_board_info`.
- Lists and cards: `get_lists`, `get_cards_by_list_id`, `get_card`,
  `add_card_to_list`, `update_card_details`, `move_card`, `archive_card`,
  `copy_card`, `add_cards_to_list`, `get_my_cards`, `get_card_history`.
- Checklists: `create_checklist`, `get_checklist_items`,
  `add_checklist_item`, `find_checklist_items_by_description`,
  `get_acceptance_criteria`, `get_checklist_by_name`,
  `update_checklist_item`, `delete_checklist_item`, `copy_checklist`.
- Comments: `add_comment`, `update_comment`, `delete_comment`,
  `get_card_comments`.
- Attachments: `attach_image_to_card`, `attach_file_to_card`,
  `attach_image_data_to_card`, `download_attachment`.
- Labels and members: `get_board_labels`, `create_label`, `update_label`,
  `delete_label`, `get_board_members`, `assign_member_to_card`,
  `remove_member_from_card`.
- Health: `get_health`, `get_health_detailed`, `get_health_metadata`,
  `get_health_performance`, `perform_system_repair`.

## Ambient Board Selection

`set_active_board`, `set_active_workspace`, and `get_active_board_info` are
registered only when ambient board and workspace selection is on. It is on for
the stdio transport and off for the HTTP transport
(`TRELLO_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`), unless `TRELLO_MCP_AMBIENT_SELECTION=on|off`
overrides it.

Check `tools/list` instead of assuming. When the three tools are absent there is
no active board: pass `boardId` on the tools that accept it, or rely on
`TRELLO_BOARD_ID`. Workspace targeting is then explicit only, so `create_board`
under `TRELLO_ALLOWED_WORKSPACES` requires an explicit `idOrganization`.

## Agent Rules

- Always discover the board, list, card, checklist, label, or member ID through
  tools before writing changes.
- When `set_active_board` is registered, prefer it after board discovery when
  several operations target the same board. When it is absent, carry the board
  ID as an explicit `boardId` argument instead, or rely on `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`.
- Pass `boardId` only to the tools that declare it. Card, list, and attachment
  tools such as `get_cards_by_list_id`, `add_card_to_list`,
  `update_card_details`, `archive_card`, and the `attach_*` tools do not accept
  it; Trello card, list, and attachment IDs are already globally unique.
- Use start dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Use due dates as full ISO 8601 timestamps.
- Treat Trello API writes as external side effects. Confirm destructive actions
  such as archive, delete, or repair unless the user already authorized them.
- Respect Trello rate limits: 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key and 100
  requests per 10 seconds per token. The server queues requests, but agents
  should still batch discovery and avoid polling loops.
